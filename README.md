# Once A Dino Always A Dino
Once a Dino Always A Dino- it is a brief story of a dinosaur fighting it's way back from extinction. Much more twists awaits. I have uploaded my game's full gameplay in LINK TO PRODUCT WALKTHROUGH as my file's size exceedes 25mb and I am unable to upload it. Those who want to Play the og game may pleaase contact me as it maybe much more fun than watching a video.
